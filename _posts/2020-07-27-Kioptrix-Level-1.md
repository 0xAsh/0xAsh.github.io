In preperation for my OSCP exam, I tackled a series of VulnHub boxes, Kioptrix Level 1 being the first. In retrospect, this box is _really_, _really_ old. Like _2010_ old, so it's real-life applicability is questionable. 

It is a simple boot-to-root box that is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability impacting its Samba service.

It's good baseline prep for anyone studying for their OSCP/PWK, learning Network pentesting, and trying to get some practice enumerating a box.

I'll assume you've already got the box running and are able to reach it. Let's get going.

# Enumeration

```

Cool, we see quite a few interesting possibilities here. Let's start from bottom to top manually enumerating each open port.


### Enumerating SSH

We can use Netcat to quickly grab the service banner on port 22. You'll notice that this appeared on NMAP scans too, but manually fingerprinting the service isn't _always_ a waste of time.

```bash
ein@~/VulnHub/Kioptrix1:$ nc 10.0.0.35 22
SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_2.9p2
^C
```

Which reveals that the SSH verson is `SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_2.9p2`. We will keep that in mind and move on to HTTP.


### Enumerating HTTP

Browsing to the port 80 via a web browser simply displays the default Apache landing page.

![Browsing to HTTP](/assets/images/VulnHub/Kioptrix1_1.PNG)

Let's fingerprint the port using netcat and try to find out what version of Apache is running: 
```bash
ein@~/VulnHub/Kioptrix1:$ nc 10.0.0.35 80
GET / HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:12:21 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.20 (Unix)  (Red-Hat/Linux) mod_ssl/2.8.4 OpenSSL/0.9.6b
Last-Modified: Thu, 06 Sep 2001 03:12:46 GMT
ETag: "8805-b4a-3b96e9ae"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 2890
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
```

Cool, so we can see that `Apache/1.3.20` is running as well as `mod_ssl/2.8.4` and `OpenSSL/0.9.6b`. Let's remember these version numbers for later.

### Enumerating SMB 

We'll skip up to port 139. I'll go ahead and use `smbclient` to see if there are any shares on the machine:

```bash
smbclient -m SMB2 -N -L //10.0.0.35/
Server does not support EXTENDED_SECURITY  but 'client use spnego = yes' and 'client ntlmv2 auth = yes' is set
Anonymous login successful

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (Samba Server)
        ADMIN$          IPC       IPC Service (Samba Server)
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
Server does not support EXTENDED_SECURITY  but 'client use spnego = yes' and 'client ntlmv2 auth = yes' is set
Anonymous login successful

        Server               Comment
        ---------            -------
        KIOPTRIX             Samba Server

        Workgroup            Master
        ---------            -------
        MYGROUP              KIOPTRIX

```

Okay, looks like the `IPC$` and `ADMIN$` shares are hosted via SMB. Let's see if we can connect to these shares:

```bash
ein@~/VulnHub/Kioptrix1:$ smbclient -m SMB2 -N //10.0.0.35/IPC$
Server does not support EXTENDED_SECURITY  but 'client use spnego = yes' and 'client ntlmv2 auth = yes' is set
Anonymous login successful
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls
NT_STATUS_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED listing \*
smb: \> exit
ein@~/VulnHub/Kioptrix1:$ smbclient -m SMB2 -N //10.0.0.35/ADMIN$
Server does not support EXTENDED_SECURITY  but 'client use spnego = yes' and 'client ntlmv2 auth = yes' is set
Anonymous login successful
tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_WRONG_PASSWORD
```

No luck, let's grab the SMB version before moving on. I'll quickly use the `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version` Metasploit module to perform this:

```bash
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > run

[*] 10.0.0.35:139         - Host could not be identified: Unix (Samba 2.2.1a)
[*] 10.0.0.35:445         - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > 
```

### Enumerating HTTPS

Looking at port 443 with a web browser reveals the same default landing page.

![Browsing to HTTP](/assets/images/VulnHub/Kioptrix1_2.PNG)

At this point, it feels like a good time to go ahead and try to directory brute-force the web server.
Let's kick this off on both port 80 and 443 while we hit some other services. We'll use `ffuf` for this:

#### HTTPS:

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt  -u https://10.0.0.35/FUZZ
```

#### HTTP:

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt  -u http://10.0.0.35/FUZZ
```

Let's take a look at the results:
```bash

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\      
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/      
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\       
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

Let's take a look using a web browser:

![Browsing to HTTP](/assets/images/VulnHub/Kioptrix1_3.PNG)

Interesting, it's hosting some network monitoring software called `Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG)`.

Unfortunately, further Googling eventually shows this is a dead end.

# Exploitation

Let's go back to those version numbers we grabbed during the enumeration phase. If we google the Samba version (2.2.1a), we can quickly find an [interesting exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/10).

This is a really old exploit, but so is the box.. Let's see if it works. We can start by grabbing it and compiling it using GCC.

```bash
wget https://www.exploit-db.com/download/10
```

Let's remove all the garbage comments from the top, and save it with the `.c` file extension.

```bash
vim 10
```

Now let's compile it using GCC

```bash
gcc exploit.c -o exploit
```

To run the compiled exploit, we'll need to specify the architecture via `-b 0` and then the IP as the positional argument `<Target IP>`.

![Running the exploit](/assets/images/VulnHub/Kioptrix1_4.PNG)

# Privilege Escalation

After running the exploit, we are dropped directly into a root shell. So that's it, rooted!
