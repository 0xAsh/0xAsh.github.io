My name's Asher, but you can call me Ash. 

I've worked in security for a short (but fun) time, with a much longer history of enjoying 
being in front of a keyboard.

During the daytime I find things so I can help people find solutions to problems. 

During the nighttime I try to learn more so I can find more 
things during the day.

## Talk To Me
If you want to talk to me please don't hesitate to hit me up. I prefer Keybase for 
communication, but am active on Twitter as well.
