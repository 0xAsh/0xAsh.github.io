Hi, I'm Ash.

I've worked in security for a short (but fun) time, with a much longer history of enjoying 
using computers.

I currently work as a penetration tester full-time, trying to help illustrate and locate problems for people. More importantly, I try to help people _fix_ the problems I find.

Outside of work I enjoy learning new things through resources like HackTheBox or certifications. As of late I'm especaily interested in learning more about Windows/AD, so you might see more content focused around those topics.

## Talk To Me
I like meeting new people, so don't hesitate to hit me up if you like. I prefer Keybase for 
communication, but am active on Twitter as well.
